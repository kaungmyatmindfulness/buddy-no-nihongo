# Wise Owl Monitoring Setup - Complete Implementation

## ‚úÖ Monitoring System Successfully Configured

Your Wise Owl microservices project now has a comprehensive monitoring setup that works for both **development** and **AWS production** environments.

## üè• Health Check Endpoints

### Service-Level Health Checks

Each service (`users`, `content`, `quiz`) exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint        | Purpose                                        | Response                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/health/`      | Basic health status with database connectivity | `{"status":"healthy","service":"...","timestamp":"...","uptime":"...","database":"connected"}` |
| `/health/ready` | Readiness probe (for ALB health checks)        | `{"ready":true}`                                                                               |
| `/health/live`  | Liveness probe (for ECS health checks)         | `{"status":"alive","service":"...","timestamp":"..."}`                                         |
| `/health/deep`  | Comprehensive health info (AWS-specific)       | Detailed system metrics                                                                        |

### Gateway-Level Health Checks

Access services through the Nginx API Gateway:

| Endpoint                                          | Service         | Purpose                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `http://localhost:8080/health-check`              | Nginx Gateway   | Gateway health status     |
| `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/health`       | Users Service   | Health through gateway    |
| `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/health/ready` | Users Service   | Readiness through gateway |
| `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/content/health`     | Content Service | Health through gateway    |
| `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/quiz/health`        | Quiz Service    | Health through gateway    |

## üîß Monitoring Tools

### 1. Basic Health Test Script

```bash
./wise-owl.sh dev test
```

**Features:**

- Tests all services (direct + gateway)
- Validates gateway routing
- Clear success/warning indicators
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 2. Comprehensive Health Monitor

```bash
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local once          # Single check
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local continuous    # Auto-refresh
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local report        # JSON report
```

**Features:**

- Detailed service health information
- Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals
- JSON status reports for automation
- Support for both local and AWS environments
- Logging to `/tmp/wise-owl-health-monitor.log`

### 3. Web Dashboard (Optional)

```bash
./scripts/monitoring/dashboard-server.sh 3000
# Access at: http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html
```

**Features:**

- Real-time web-based monitoring
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Visual status indicators
- Service uptime and database connectivity
- Mobile-responsive design

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Components

### Health Check Implementation

**Environment Detection:**

```go
// Automatically chooses the right health checker
if config.IsAWSEnvironment() {
    healthChecker = health.NewAWSHealthChecker("Service Name", mongoDatabase)
} else {
    healthChecker = health.NewSimpleHealthChecker("Service Name")
}
```

**Health Check Types:**

- **SimpleHealthChecker**: Basic health checks for local development
- **AWSHealthChecker**: Enhanced health checks with detailed metrics for AWS
- **AWSEnhancedHealthChecker**: Comprehensive monitoring for production

### Docker Health Checks

Each service container includes health checks:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test:
    [
      "CMD",
      "wget",
      "--no-verbose",
      "--tries=1",
      "--spider",
      "http://localhost:8080/health/ready",
    ]
  interval: 15s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 30s
```

### Nginx Gateway Configuration

**Health Endpoint Routing:**

- Direct access to service health endpoints through the gateway
- Proper proxy headers for request tracing
- Health check aggregation for external monitoring

## üöÄ AWS Production Monitoring

### ECS Task Health Checks

```json
"healthCheck": {
    "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8081/health/ready || exit 1"],
    "interval": 30,
    "timeout": 5,
    "retries": 3,
    "startPeriod": 60
}
```

### ALB Target Group Health Checks

- **Health check path**: `/api/v1/{service}/health/ready`
- **Healthy threshold**: 2 consecutive successes
- **Unhealthy threshold**: 3 consecutive failures
- **Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds

### CloudWatch Integration

- Application logs: `/ecs/wise-owl`
- Health check metrics automatically collected
- ALB and ECS metrics for monitoring

## üìä Current Status

‚úÖ **All services are healthy and monitored:**

- Users Service: `http://localhost:8081/health/`
- Content Service: `http://localhost:8082/health/`
- Quiz Service: `http://localhost:8083/health/`
- Nginx Gateway: `http://localhost:8080/health-check`

‚úÖ **Gateway routing working:**

- `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/health`
- `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/content/health`
- `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/quiz/health`

‚úÖ **Monitoring tools operational:**

- Basic test script: `./wise-owl.sh dev test`
- Comprehensive monitor: `./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh`
- Web dashboard available (with separate server)

## üéØ Best Practices Implemented

1. **Multiple Health Check Types**: Basic, readiness, liveness, and deep health checks
2. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Different health checkers for local vs AWS
3. **Database Connectivity Monitoring**: Real-time database health status
4. **Gateway-Level Monitoring**: End-to-end health through the API gateway
5. **Automated Testing**: Scriptable health checks for CI/CD
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
7. **JSON API Responses**: Machine-readable health status
8. **Visual Monitoring**: Web dashboard for real-time status

## üîÑ Regular Monitoring Workflow

### Development

```bash
# Quick health check
./wise-owl.sh dev test

# Detailed monitoring
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local continuous

# Generate status report
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local report
```

### Production (AWS)

```bash
# Check AWS environment
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh aws once

# Monitor production services
ALB_DNS=your-alb-dns.elb.amazonaws.com ./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh aws continuous
```
