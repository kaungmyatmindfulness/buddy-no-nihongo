# Deployment Scripts Removal Summary

This document tracks the removal of deployment scripts and the adjustments made to references throughout the codebase.

## Removed Scripts

The following deployment scripts have been temporarily removed and will be added back later:

- `scripts/deployment/setup-raspberry-pi-generic.sh` - Server setup script
- `scripts/deployment/deploy-wise-owl.sh` - Application deployment script
- `scripts/deployment/setup-documentdb.sh` - AWS DocumentDB setup script
- `scripts/deployment/test-migration.sh` - Migration testing script

## Files Updated

### Main Scripts

- ✅ `wise-owl` - Updated usage help to note deployment scripts removal
- ✅ `scripts/show-organization.sh` - Removed deployment script references from structure display

### Documentation

- ✅ `README.md` - Updated deployment sections and script categories
- ✅ `scripts/README.md` - Updated directory structure and environment file references
- ✅ `monitoring/README.md` - Updated production deployment section

### Migration Documents

- ✅ `documents/MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated deployment script references
- ✅ `documents/AWS_DOCUMENTDB_MIGRATION.md` - Updated DocumentDB setup instructions
- ✅ `documents/COMPLETE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Updated deployment commands and documentation sections

## Alternative Methods

For deployment without the scripts, users can:

1. **Manual Setup**: Set up servers and AWS resources manually through their respective consoles
2. **Docker Compose**: Use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` for application deployment
3. **GitHub Actions**: The existing GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-secure.yml` still works for automated deployment

## When Scripts Are Re-added

When deployment scripts are added back:

1. Update the main `wise-owl` script to add deployment category
2. Restore deployment references in `scripts/show-organization.sh`
3. Update all documentation to reference the new scripts
4. Update environment file handling for `.env.docker`
5. Test all script integrations

## Status

✅ **Complete** - All references to removed deployment scripts have been updated or marked as temporarily unavailable.
