### Service Overview

| Service             | Dev Port | Prod Port | Purpose                                   | Database     |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Users Service**   | 8081     | Internal  | User management, profiles, authentication | `users_db`   |
| **Content Service** | 8082     | Internal  | Vocabulary data, lessons management       | `content_db` |
| **Quiz Service**    | 8083     | Internal  | Quiz logic, incorrect words tracking      | `quiz_db`    |
| **API Gateway**     | 8080     | 80        | Nginx reverse proxy, routing              | -            |
| **MongoDB**         | 27017    | Internal  | Database cluster (local dev only)         | -            |

### Communication Patterns

- **External API**: HTTP REST via Nginx gateway (`/api/v1/{service}/`)
- **Internal Communication**: gRPC on dedicated ports (50051, 50052, 50053)
- **Database**: MongoDB (local dev) or AWS DocumentDB (production) with dedicated databases per service
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens validated via Auth0 (optional in development)

## üìú Scripts Documentation

### Overview: What, Why, and How

The Wise Owl project uses a structured script system to simplify development workflows. These scripts automate complex Docker Compose operations, environment setup, and health checking.

#### **What**: Script Categories

The project organizes scripts into two main categories:

1. **Development Scripts** (`scripts/development/`): Local development environment management
2. **Utility Scripts** (`scripts/utils/`): Shared functions and common utilities

**Note**: Deployment scripts have been temporarily removed and will be added back later.

#### **Why**: The Need for Script Automation

- **Complexity Management**: Managing 5+ microservices with Docker Compose requires many commands
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensures all developers use the same setup procedures
- **Error Reduction**: Automated health checks and validation prevent common mistakes
- **Onboarding Speed**: New developers can start with a single command

#### **How**: Running the Scripts

### Main Entry Point: `./wise-owl`

The project provides a unified command interface through the main `./wise-owl` script:

```bash
# Check all available commands
./wise-owl --help

# Development commands
./wise-owl dev <command>

# Monitoring commands
./wise-owl monitor <command>
```

### Development Scripts

#### 1. Environment Setup and Management

**Initial Setup** - Creates environment files and validates prerequisites:

```bash
# What: Creates .env.local from .env.example template
# Why: Ensures consistent environment configuration
# How: Copy and customize the example environment
./wise-owl dev setup
```

**Start Development Environment** - Launches all microservices:

```bash
# What: Starts all services (nginx, users, content, quiz, mongodb)
# Why: Single command to launch the entire development stack
# How: Uses docker-compose.dev.yml with development configurations
./wise-owl dev start
```

**Hot Reload Development** - Starts with automatic code reloading:

```bash
# What: Starts services with Docker Compose watch mode
# Why: Automatically rebuilds containers when code changes
# How: Requires Docker Compose 2.22+, falls back to normal mode if unsupported
./wise-owl dev watch
```

#### 2. Service Management

**Stop Services** - Cleanly shuts down all containers:

```bash
# What: Stops all running Docker containers
# Why: Clean shutdown preserves data and prevents port conflicts
# How: Uses docker-compose down command
./wise-owl dev stop
```

**Restart Services** - Stops and starts services:

```bash
# What: Combines stop and start operations
# Why: Quick way to apply configuration changes
# How: Runs stop followed by start
./wise-owl dev restart
```

**View Logs** - Monitor service output:

```bash
# What: Shows logs from all services or specific service
# Why: Essential for debugging and monitoring
# How: Uses docker-compose logs with follow mode

# All services
./wise-owl dev logs

# Specific service
./wise-owl dev logs users-service
```

#### 3. Development Utilities

**Health Check** - Validates all services are responding:

```bash
# What: Tests HTTP endpoints on all microservices and gateway routing
# Why: Quickly verify that all services are healthy and properly connected
# How: Curl requests to /health endpoints on each service + gateway routing tests
./wise-owl.sh dev test
```

## üîç Health Monitoring & Observability

Wise Owl includes a comprehensive monitoring system designed for both development and production environments.

### Health Check Endpoints

Every service exposes multiple health check endpoints for different use cases:

| Endpoint        | Purpose                        | Response Format                         | Use Case                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `/health/`      | Basic health + database status | JSON with uptime, database connectivity | Development monitoring           |
| `/health/ready` | Readiness probe                | `{"ready": true/false}`                 | ALB health checks, K8s readiness |
| `/health/live`  | Liveness probe                 | `{"status": "alive"}`                   | ECS health checks, K8s liveness  |
| `/health/deep`  | Comprehensive metrics          | Detailed system info                    | AWS CloudWatch, debugging        |

### Gateway Health Monitoring

Access health endpoints through the API Gateway for end-to-end monitoring:

```bash
# Gateway health
curl http://localhost:8080/health-check

# Service health through gateway
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/content/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/quiz/health

# Readiness checks for load balancer
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users/health/ready
```

### Monitoring Tools

#### 1. Quick Health Check

```bash
# Basic health validation
./wise-owl dev test
```

**Features:** Tests all services + gateway routing, clear pass/fail indicators, CI/CD friendly

#### 2. Comprehensive Monitor

```bash
# Single comprehensive check
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local once

# Continuous monitoring (auto-refresh every 30s)
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local continuous

# Generate JSON status report
./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh local report
```

**Features:** Detailed health information, continuous monitoring, JSON reports for automation, supports both local and AWS environments

#### 3. Web Dashboard

```bash
# Start monitoring dashboard server
./scripts/monitoring/dashboard-server.sh 3000

# Access at: http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html
```

**Features:** Real-time web interface, auto-refresh, visual status indicators, mobile-responsive

### Production Monitoring (AWS)

The monitoring system is AWS-ready with:

- **ECS Health Checks**: Container-level health validation
- **ALB Target Groups**: Load balancer health routing
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Automated log collection and metrics
- **Route 53 Health Checks**: DNS-level failover capability

```bash
# Monitor AWS production environment
ALB_DNS=your-alb-dns.elb.amazonaws.com ./scripts/monitoring/health-monitor.sh aws continuous
```

### Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Development**: Use `./wise-owl.sh dev test` for quick validation
2. **CI/CD**: Integrate health checks in deployment pipelines
3. **Production**: Set up continuous monitoring with alerting
4. **Debugging**: Use `/health/deep` endpoints for detailed diagnostics

For complete monitoring setup details, see `MONITORING_SETUP.md`.

**Service Status** - Shows current state of containers:

```bash
# What: Displays Docker container status and resource usage
# Why: Quick overview of what's running and resource consumption
# How: Uses docker-compose ps and docker stats
./wise-owl dev status
```

**Build Services** - Rebuild containers from scratch:

```bash
# What: Rebuilds all Docker images without cache
# Why: Apply Dockerfile changes or clear build issues
# How: Uses docker-compose build --no-cache
./wise-owl dev build
```

**Clean Environment** - Complete cleanup:

```bash
# What: Stops containers, removes volumes and images
# Why: Fresh start when development environment has issues
# How: docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
./wise-owl dev clean
```

### Direct Script Access

If you prefer to run scripts directly instead of using the unified interface:

```bash
# Development scripts
./scripts/development/dev.sh [command]          # Main development manager
./scripts/development/dev-watch.sh              # Hot reload development
./scripts/development/test-dev.sh               # Health check testing

# Utility scripts
./scripts/utils/common.sh                       # Shared functions (sourced by others)
```

### Script Requirements and Prerequisites

#### Development Requirements

- **Docker**: Version 20.10+ with Docker Compose
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- **Ports**: 8080-8083, 27017, 50051-50053 must be available
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 2GB for Docker images and volumes

#### Deployment Requirements

**Note**: Deployment scripts have been temporarily removed and will be added back later.

For manual deployment:

- **Target Server**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ recommended
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Required on target server
- **Network**: Internet connectivity for image downloads
- **Resources**: Minimum 2GB RAM, 10GB disk space

### Environment Files

The scripts work with different environment configurations:

- **`.env.local`**: Development environment (created by `./wise-owl dev setup`)
- **`.env.local.example`**: Template file with all required variables for local development
- **`.env.aws.example`**: Template file for AWS deployment configuration
- **`.env.ecs.example`**: Template file specifically for ECS task definitions

**Note**: The project includes multiple environment templates to support different deployment scenarios.

### Troubleshooting Scripts

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

1. **Port conflicts**:

   ```bash
   # Check what's using ports
   lsof -i :8080
   ./wise-owl dev stop  # Stop services to free ports
   ```

2. **Docker permission issues**:

   ```bash
   # Add user to docker group (requires logout/login)
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

3. **Services not starting**:

   ```bash
   # Check service logs
   ./wise-owl dev logs

   # Rebuild containers
   ./wise-owl dev build
   ```

4. **Database issues**:

   ```bash
   # Clean restart with fresh database
   ./wise-owl dev clean
   ./wise-owl dev start
   ```

### Script Customization

The scripts are designed to be extensible. Key customization points:

- **`scripts/utils/common.sh`**: Shared functions and configuration
- **Environment variables**: Override defaults through `.env.local`
- **Docker Compose**: Modify `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development changes
- **Service ports**: Configure in individual service Docker files

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Go Workspaces**: Single repository with multiple modules
- **Dual Servers**: Each service runs both HTTP (external) and gRPC (internal) servers
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data (microservices pattern)
- **Shared Libraries**: Common functionality in `lib/` (auth, config, database, health)
- **Generated Code**: Protocol buffers generate gRPC client/server code

### Authentication Flow

1. Frontend authenticates with Auth0
2. JWT token passed in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
3. `lib/auth.EnsureValidToken()` middleware validates token
4. User ID extracted and available in request context

### Inter-service Communication

- **Content ‚Üí Quiz**: gRPC `GetVocabularyBatch` for vocabulary details
- **Services ‚Üí Database**: Direct MongoDB connections with dedicated databases
- **External ‚Üí Services**: HTTP REST via Nginx gateway routing

## üîÑ Adding New Services

1. **Create Service Structure**

   ```bash
   # Create service directory following existing pattern
   mkdir -p services/notifications/{cmd,internal/{handlers,models,grpc,seeder}}

   # Create go.mod for the service
   cd services/notifications
   go mod init wise-owl/services/notifications
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**

   ```bash
   # Add to go.work
   echo "./services/notifications" >> go.work

   # Add to docker-compose.dev.yml
   # Add to nginx/default.conf for routing
   ```

3. **Implement Business Logic**

   ```bash
   cd services/notifications
   # Create cmd/main.go following existing service patterns
   # Edit internal/handlers/, internal/models/, etc.
   ```

4. **Define gRPC Contracts** (if needed)

   ```bash
   # Create proto/notifications/notifications.proto
   # Generate code: protoc --go_out=gen --go-grpc_out=gen proto/notifications/*.proto
   ```

## ü§ù Contributing

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the established patterns in existing services (see `services/content` as reference)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for API changes
- Use conventional commit messages

### Code Style

- Follow Go conventions and `gofmt` formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic
- Handle errors appropriately with proper HTTP status codes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes following project patterns
3. Add/update tests as needed
4. Ensure all services pass health checks
5. Update documentation if needed
