## üìú Scripts Documentation

### Overview: What, Why, and How

The Wise Owl project uses a structured script system to simplify development workflows. These scripts automate complex Docker Compose operations, environment setup, and health checking.

#### **What**: Script Categories

The project organizes scripts into two main categories:

1. **Development Scripts** (`scripts/development/`): Local development environment management
2. **Utility Scripts** (`scripts/utils/`): Shared functions and common utilities

**Note**: Deployment scripts have been temporarily removed and will be added back later.

#### **Why**: The Need for Script Automation

- **Complexity Management**: Managing 5+ microservices with Docker Compose requires many commands
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensures all developers use the same setup procedures
- **Error Reduction**: Automated health checks and validation prevent common mistakes
- **Onboarding Speed**: New developers can start with a single command

#### **How**: Running the Scripts

### Main Entry Point: `./wise-owl`

The project provides a unified command interface through the main `./wise-owl` script:

```bash
# Check all available commands
./wise-owl --help

# Development commands
./wise-owl dev <command>

# Monitoring commands
./wise-owl monitor <command>
```

### Development Scripts

#### 1. Environment Setup and Management

**Initial Setup** - Creates environment files and validates prerequisites:

```bash
# What: Creates .env.local from .env.example template
# Why: Ensures consistent environment configuration
# How: Copy and customize the example environment
./wise-owl dev setup
```

**Start Development Environment** - Launches all microservices:

```bash
# What: Starts all services (nginx, users, content, quiz, mongodb)
# Why: Single command to launch the entire development stack
# How: Uses docker-compose.dev.yml with development configurations
./wise-owl dev start
```

**Hot Reload Development** - Starts with automatic code reloading:

```bash
# What: Starts services with Docker Compose watch mode
# Why: Automatically rebuilds containers when code changes
# How: Requires Docker Compose 2.22+, falls back to normal mode if unsupported
./wise-owl dev watch
```

#### 2. Service Management

**Stop Services** - Cleanly shuts down all containers:

```bash
# What: Stops all running Docker containers
# Why: Clean shutdown preserves data and prevents port conflicts
# How: Uses docker-compose down command
./wise-owl dev stop
```

**Restart Services** - Stops and starts services:

```bash
# What: Combines stop and start operations
# Why: Quick way to apply configuration changes
# How: Runs stop followed by start
./wise-owl dev restart
```

**View Logs** - Monitor service output:

```bash
# What: Shows logs from all services or specific service
# Why: Essential for debugging and monitoring
# How: Uses docker-compose logs with follow mode

# All services
./wise-owl dev logs

# Specific service
./wise-owl dev logs users-service
```

#### 3. Development Utilities

**Health Check** - Validates all services are responding:

```bash
# What: Tests HTTP endpoints on all microservices
# Why: Quickly verify that all services are healthy
# How: Curl requests to /health endpoints on each service
./wise-owl dev test
```

**Service Status** - Shows current state of containers:

```bash
# What: Displays Docker container status and resource usage
# Why: Quick overview of what's running and resource consumption
# How: Uses docker-compose ps and docker stats
./wise-owl dev status
```

**Build Services** - Rebuild containers from scratch:

```bash
# What: Rebuilds all Docker images without cache
# Why: Apply Dockerfile changes or clear build issues
# How: Uses docker-compose build --no-cache
./wise-owl dev build
```

**Clean Environment** - Complete cleanup:

```bash
# What: Stops containers, removes volumes and images
# Why: Fresh start when development environment has issues
# How: docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
./wise-owl dev clean
```

### Direct Script Access

If you prefer to run scripts directly instead of using the unified interface:

```bash
# Development scripts
./scripts/development/dev.sh [command]          # Main development manager
./scripts/development/dev-watch.sh              # Hot reload development
./scripts/development/test-dev.sh               # Health check testing

# Utility scripts
./scripts/utils/common.sh                       # Shared functions (sourced by others)
```

### Script Requirements and Prerequisites

#### Development Requirements

- **Docker**: Version 20.10+ with Docker Compose
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- **Ports**: 8080-8083, 27017, 50051-50053 must be available
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 2GB for Docker images and volumes

#### Deployment Requirements

**Note**: Deployment scripts have been temporarily removed and will be added back later.

For manual deployment:

- **Target Server**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ recommended
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Required on target server
- **Network**: Internet connectivity for image downloads
- **Resources**: Minimum 2GB RAM, 10GB disk space

### Environment Files

The scripts work with different environment configurations:

- **`.env.local`**: Development environment (created by `./wise-owl dev setup`)
- **`.env.local.example`**: Template file with all required variables for local development
- **`.env.aws.example`**: Template file for AWS deployment configuration
- **`.env.ecs.example`**: Template file specifically for ECS task definitions

**Note**: The project includes multiple environment templates to support different deployment scenarios.

### Troubleshooting Scripts

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

1. **Port conflicts**:

   ```bash
   # Check what's using ports
   lsof -i :8080
   ./wise-owl dev stop  # Stop services to free ports
   ```

2. **Docker permission issues**:

   ```bash
   # Add user to docker group (requires logout/login)
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

3. **Services not starting**:

   ```bash
   # Check service logs
   ./wise-owl dev logs

   # Rebuild containers
   ./wise-owl dev build
   ```

4. **Database issues**:

   ```bash
   # Clean restart with fresh database
   ./wise-owl dev clean
   ./wise-owl dev start
   ```

### Script Customization

The scripts are designed to be extensible. Key customization points:

- **`scripts/utils/common.sh`**: Shared functions and configuration
- **Environment variables**: Override defaults through `.env.local`
- **Docker Compose**: Modify `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development changes
- **Service ports**: Configure in individual service Docker files

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: `.env.local` with hot reload and direct service access
- **Production**: `.env.production` with optimized builds and gateway-only access

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test individual service
cd services/users
go test ./...

# Test all services
for service in users content quiz; do
  echo "Testing $service..."
  cd services/$service && go test ./...
  cd ../..
done

# Integration testing
./test-dev.sh  # Tests service health and connectivity
```

### Health Check Testing

```bash
# Individual service health
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Gateway health
curl http://localhost/health-check

# Service readiness
curl http://localhost:8081/health/ready
```

## üèõÔ∏è Project Structure & Patterns

### Service Structure (Standard Pattern)

```text
services/{name}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/main.go                 # Entry point with dual HTTP+gRPC servers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers/               # HTTP REST endpoint handlers
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grpc/                   # gRPC service implementations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                 # MongoDB data models
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ seeder/                 # Database initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile & Dockerfile.dev # Container configurations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod                      # Service dependencies
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Go Workspaces**: Single repository with multiple modules
- **Dual Servers**: Each service runs both HTTP (external) and gRPC (internal) servers
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data (microservices pattern)
- **Shared Libraries**: Common functionality in `lib/` (auth, config, database, health)
- **Generated Code**: Protocol buffers generate gRPC client/server code

### Authentication Flow

1. Frontend authenticates with Auth0
2. JWT token passed in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
3. `lib/auth.EnsureValidToken()` middleware validates token
4. User ID extracted and available in request context

### Inter-service Communication

- **Content ‚Üí Quiz**: gRPC `GetVocabularyBatch` for vocabulary details
- **Services ‚Üí Database**: Direct MongoDB connections with dedicated databases
- **External ‚Üí Services**: HTTP REST via Nginx gateway routing

## üîÑ Adding New Services

1. **Create Service Structure**

   ```bash
   # Create service directory following existing pattern
   mkdir -p services/notifications/{cmd,internal/{handlers,models,grpc,seeder}}

   # Create go.mod for the service
   cd services/notifications
   go mod init wise-owl/services/notifications
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**

   ```bash
   # Add to go.work
   echo "./services/notifications" >> go.work

   # Add to docker-compose.dev.yml
   # Add to nginx/default.conf for routing
   ```

3. **Implement Business Logic**

   ```bash
   cd services/notifications
   # Create cmd/main.go following existing service patterns
   # Edit internal/handlers/, internal/models/, etc.
   ```

4. **Define gRPC Contracts** (if needed)

   ```bash
   # Create proto/notifications/notifications.proto
   # Generate code: protoc --go_out=gen --go-grpc_out=gen proto/notifications/*.proto
   ```

## ü§ù Contributing
